Considering using only the available eletronics components present in the BitDogLab(https://github.com/BitDogLab/BitDogLab) hardware we chose to create a digital canvas, naming the project "The New Modern Art". By defining a 100x50 canvas on the oled and thus having 20 5x5 matrices to edit bit by bit on the LEDs, the joystick defines the position of the brush that flashes in the position it is in, button A records and button B erases, while the button on the joystick itself defines the color. When you get to the edge of a 5x5 matrix, if there's one next to it, you change which one appears, but on the oled you can see the whole canvas. As the oled has only two colors, the complete view is limited, but when you go through the matrices you can see the colors you've chosen.
