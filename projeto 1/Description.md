# The New Modern Art

Utilizing solely the electronic components available in the BitDogLab hardware, we embarked on crafting a digital canvas, aptly titled "The New Modern Art". This project involves the creation of a 100x50 canvas displayed on an OLED screen, which is further divided into twenty 5x5 matrices. These matrices can be individually manipulated bit by bit using the Matrix LEDs, providing a unique medium for digital artistry.

The control scheme is intuitive: a joystick navigates the position of the 'brush', which illuminates at the current location in the Matrix. Button A serves to 'record' or place the LED, while button B acts as an eraser. Additionally, the joystick's own button is designated for selecting colors. As one navigates to the edge of a 5x5 matrix, adjacent matrices can be transitioned into seamlessly, although the OLED provides a holistic view of the entire canvas.

Due to the OLED's two-color limitation, the full spectrum of the artwork can only be appreciated by cycling through the individual matrices, where the selected colors come to life. This innovative approach to modern art, using the BitDogLab's hardware, redefines the intersection of technology and creativity.
