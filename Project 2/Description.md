# The New Modern Art 2.0

Based on the first project “The New Modern Art”, the second proposal aims to create a version 2.0 based on cooperation between users of the board. In addition to the features already established, we will be communicating between two BitdogLab boards using the UART protocol. As we want to transmit the information from the canvas bits in such a way as to generate a shared drawing at the end, we have taken into account that the communication must take place in an orderly manner and without data collision, implementing an effective communication protocol via software.
